%using these commands will provide nicely formatted code that has syntax highlighting colours
%similar to idle

%you can include python code in a paragraph of text
Functions like \pythoninline{print()}, \pythoninline{input()} and \pythoninline{len()} exist so that you can make use of functionality that would have been daunting to write as a beginner and that would still be time consuming now.

%you can also include a code listing from an external file
%the lastline argument is optional
\begin{figure}[H]
    \pythonfile[firstline=5,lastline=5]{./tex/function_programs/print_function.py}
    \caption{The print() function} \label{fig:print_function}
\end{figure}


%if needed you can write code directly
\begin{python}
print("hello world")
\end{python}
