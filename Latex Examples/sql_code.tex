%using these commands will provide nicely formatted code that has nice syntax highlighting colours

%you can include sql code in a paragraph of text
To implement the product entity we must use the \textbf{\sqlinline{create table}} statement. Notice, that the statement is called \sqlinline{create table} and not \sqlinline{create entity} - this is because entity is used to refer to the abstract representation and table to refer to the actual implementation.

%you can also include a code listing from an external file
%the lastline argument is optional

    \sqlfile[firstline=5,lastline=5]{./tex/sql_example.py}

\end{figure}


%if needed you can write code directly
\begin{sql}
CREATE TABLE Product(
    ProductID integer,
    Name text,
    Price real,
    Primary Key(ProductID));
\end{sql}
