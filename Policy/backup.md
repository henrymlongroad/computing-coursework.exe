#Version control and backing-up your work
It is very important that you take seriously the threat of **data loss**. Writing both your coursework document and your programmed solution for the project are lengthy processes and you will not want to find yourself in a position where you have lost weeks of work due to a mistake you have made or a computer error or hardware failure.

##Version Control
Using a tool such as [Git][1] to version control your files is a good idea. Git will enable you to step back to a previous working version of your program if you make a mistake and it will also provide a log of all of the work you have done (and when) over the course of the project.

Most students use [GitHub][2] to provide a mechanism to sync changes between the version of files they have in college and those they have at home.

##Back-up
In addition to version controlling your files you will also want to back them up to avoid losing them. If you are using [GitHub][2] then you will have three copies of your files:

- In college
- At home
- On the GitHub server

This means that if you ever lose one set of files then it should not cause you too much of a problem.

If you are not using Git or want an extra back-up then use a service such as [Dropbox][3] to sync your files so that they exist **off-site**. Having files saved off-site is very important as computers do get stolen and houses do burn down.

**Do not** place yourself in a position where by losing one set of files will mean that you are unable to meet a submission deadline. **Losing work is not an acceptable reason for an extension**

You have been warned.
